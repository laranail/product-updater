# Changelog

All notable changes to `laranail/product-updater` are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The PHP floor is `^8.4.1`, up from `^8.4`. `laranail/package-tools` and `laranail/console`
  are `^8.4.1`, so a resolver that took the manifest at its word and pinned the platform to
  8.4.0 could not install them. Dependabot does exactly that, and had been failing on it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-11

Initial public release.
